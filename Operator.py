# Here we going to learn operator in the python which little
# bit different in other programming language hope we 
# will got to learn that language in fast in simple manner


# Arithmetic Operator

print("Enter the first number")
x=float(input())
print("Enter the second number")
y=float(input())

print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x/y)
print(x*y)
print(x%y)
print(x//y)
print(x**y)


#assignment operator
print("Assignment Operator")

x+=.56
x-=.2
x*=.345
x/=2

print(5 << 3)
print(3 and 5)

y=20
if(y,y==30):
	print(y)		


#logical operator
x=10
y=0
print(x and y)
print(x or y)
print(not y)


#identifier operator in python

array1 =["a","b","c"]
array2 =["a","b","c"]
array3=array1
print(array3 is array1)
print(array1 is array2)
print(array2 is not array3)
print("a" in array2)
print("d" not in array3)
